Our Agricultural Commodity Price Projection System leverages advanced machine learning algorithms to forecast future prices of agricultural commodities with accuracy and reliability. 
In an era marked by dynamic market conditions and evolving environmental factors,
this system serves as a vital tool for farmers, traders, policymakers, and stakeholders across the agricultural supply chain.

I have done this project in two parts. First part contains data analysis and cleaning. Second is training of machine learning models
1) EDA and Data Cleaning
I have done the exploratory data analysis and done following manipulations on data.

Creating new features
Removing outliers
Transforming skewed features
Checking for multicoliniearity
2) Training machine learning algorithms:
Here, I have trained various machine learning algorithms like

Linear Regression
Ridge Regression
Support Vector Regression
Gradient Boosting Regression
Stacking of various models
